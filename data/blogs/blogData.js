      "When we open the Google Play Store we are overwhelmed with the number of apps we see there, for literally every basic need there are hundreds of apps. Statistically, there are nearly 3 Million android apps on the Play Store as of now. At the beginning of this year, we(me and my team) decided to publish our own app on the play store. What once was an Instagram Page and a website to deliver Free Ebooks upon request was about to be launched as an App, we were all thrilled with the thought.",

      "Before you judge me for this unconventional statement I must tell you that I am a bookworm myself and I personally love reading books. Growing up we all have been told to develop a habit of reading books, which is really good for a number of reasons but there’s a lot of history behind it. Book readers generally think of themselves as an alpha human just because they have this habit of completing a book overnight.",
